# Snake-Game
Snake Game Python Project
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python programming language. 
The game is played on the terminal or console, and the objective is to control a snake to 
eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and its own body.

# Features:
  Snake moves in four directions: up, down, left, right.
  Snake grows longer by eating food.
  Food spawns randomly on the game board.
  Game ends when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
  Score is displayed during the game, showing the length of the snake.
  Game over message is displayed when the game ends, with an option to restart the game.

# Prerequisites:
  Python 3.x installed on your system.
  Basic knowledge of Python programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions.

# How to Run:
     Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository: 
        https://github.com/Ayush3R/Snake-Game-Python
     Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or console.
     Run the game.py file using the python command: python game.py.
     Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake.
     Try to eat food and avoid collisions with walls and the snake's own body.
     The game will display the current score and a game over message when the game ends.

# Controls:
  Use the up arrow key to move the snake up.
  Use the down arrow key to move the snake down.
  Use the left arrow key to move the snake left.
  Use the right arrow key to move the snake right.

# Dependencies:
The game uses the following Python modules:

   random module for generating random numbers for food spawning.
   curses module for creating the game window and capturing key inputs 
      for controlling the snake. Note that the curses module is only available 
      in Unix-based systems or Windows systems with the curses library installed.
